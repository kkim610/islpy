This repository contains notes and code for my workthrough of the book *An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R* by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (2013). This repository is similar to [JWarmenhoven's](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python), with our language of choice being Python instead of R.

In my youth, my calculus teacher introduced me to the chinese proverb:

> I hear and I forget,  
> I see and I remember,  
> I do and I understand.  

This, more than any other addage, has stuck with me throughout my life. I have internalized this deep yet purely simple idea that learning by doing is the most effective way of ingesting information for long-term retainage. So, although the heavy lifting has been done by many talented people before me, this repository will serve as my hands-on, made-from-scratch journey through this fantastic book.

ISLPy is by no means meant to be a complete recreation or summary of ISLR, and should be used as a secondary resource to the book instead of the primary resource. I will no doubt have spirals full of handwritten notes, ad hoc python scripts testing different algorithm implementations, and notes from external resources on complex or uncovered topics. Take ISLPy with a grain of salt, that's all I'm saying.
